# my personal website!
![HackaTime Badge](https://hackatime-badge.hackclub.com/U09GRHV7Y80/personal-website)

### Tools used to build:
***VS Code*** (finally had to set it up on my new machine)
***Figma*** (general design concepts, still don't know how to use proparly)
***Notepad*** (peak text editor, made most of the tedious things in here (terminal commands, repetetive css configs) and moved them in afterwords)
***W3Schools*** (my saviour, first time doing this)

### Languages:
***HTML
CSS
JavaScript*** (everyone's favorite)

### Features

a home page
a blog that has a repetable design for repetable posts
a projects page with itch integration
a terminal (this is where I spent all of my time, aside from forcing css to do what I want)

#### WHAT CAN THE TERMINAL DO?!?!
A lot, actually!
Commands: 
help          - displays usable commands
clear         - clears the terminal output
exit          - exit back to web ui
blog <date>   - shows the paragraph text from the blog at <date> 
contact       - shows my email
project <name>- shows the <name> project description
developer     - enables a developer page I use to see if image paths work correctly.
date          - the current date!
whoami        - a fun message to those who wander the web
uptime        - how long has this terminal been up?
version       - what is this terminal version?
roll          - finally, you can gamble in contact page
about         - about this project

Some older commits have calc and echo, those will be re-implemented when the commands are completly redesigned. (this will be done not now)

***filesystem commands are not supported, CD LS etc.*** but I do intend to make a virtual filesystem. the only problem is I would have to decide how to integrate it with the visual version. (or I could have terminal limited features?)

now, not only do you have all this, but you want to see it in action!
